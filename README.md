# EvidenceTheory
This project implements the fundamental framework of evidence theory, now encompassing the entirety of Dempster-Shafer theory. It employs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to realize evidence reasoning. We welcome scholars interested in evidence theory to enrich and refine this project, collectively advancing the development of evidence theory.
